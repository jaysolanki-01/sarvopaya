        heading: "Why Blended ROAS is an Illusion",
        body: "Most digital marketing agencies report return on ad spend (ROAS) directly from Meta Ads Manager or Google Ads. But ROAS is a platform-reported vanity metric. It does not account for payment gateway processing fees, shipping and fulfillment costs, returns and damaged stock, or cost of goods sold (COGS).\n\nA company reporting a 4.2x ROAS on Meta can easily be burning cash if the product gross margin is 45% and return rates on Cash on Delivery (COD) orders hover at 32%. Conversely, a brand operating at 2.1x ROAS with 85% gross margins and 60-day repeat purchase cycles is minting net cashflow.",

        heading: "The Three Tiers of Contribution Margin (CM1, CM2, CM3)",
        body: "To manage ad spend like a venture CFO rather than a media buyer, we structure every client's unit economics across three distinct levels:\n\n• CM1 (Gross Contribution Margin): Net Revenue minus Product Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). This measures pure product profitability before marketing.\n\n• CM2 (Order-Level Contribution Margin): CM1 minus direct variable fulfillment costs, including pick-and-pack logistics, shipping, COD verification fees, payment gateway commissions (2-3%), and expected return provisions.\n\n• CM3 (Marketing Contribution Margin): CM2 minus total direct advertising spend across all paid acquisition channels (Meta, Google, TikTok, Influencers).\n\nIf CM3 on first-time customer acquisition is positive or break-even, every subsequent repeat purchase yields near 100% net operating margin.",

At Sarvopaya, we deploy real-time webhook automations syncing Shopify/WooCommerce orders, carrier tracking APIs (Shiprocket, Delhivery, FedEx), and ad platform spend APIs directly into live BigQuery and Looker dashboards. This allows our growth teams to kill unprofitable ad sets within 48 hours rather than discovering margin leakage weeks later.",

Frequently, 20% of your product catalog generates 90% of your CM2, while popular top-sellers are secretly draining working capital on shipping weight and return logistics. Prioritize high CM2 items in your paid creative briefs to drive durable, compounding growth.",

Webhook Ingestion: Form submissions from Webflow, Next.js, or WordPress trigger an immediate payload validation node.\n2. Data Enrichment: The workflow pings Apollo.io and Clearbit APIs using the corporate domain to extract company headcount, funding stage, and tech stack.\n3. LLM Intent & Fit Analysis: The payload is sent to an enterprise Anthropic Claude or Google Gemini API prompt that scores the inquiry against ICP criteria (Ideal Customer Profile) and flags red-flag or spam submissions.\n4. Dual Notification Dispatch: High-score leads trigger an immediate automated WhatsApp conversational message to the prospect with a Cal.com booking link, while sending an instant priority alert with call summary to the account executive's Slack channel.",

Information Density: Avoid generic filler copy. State facts, statistics, and verifiable claims in concise, structured sentences.\n2. Citable Quote Blocks: Structure key conclusions in distinct definition cards or semantic callouts that crawlers can parse directly without summarization distortion.\n3. Deep JSON-LD Structured Data: Implement comprehensive nested schema including WebPage, BreadcrumbList, TechArticle, FAQPage, and Organization schemas with verified wikidata identifiers.\n4. Rendering Speed & Server-Side Hydration: Heavy client-side JavaScript applications that fail to deliver server-rendered HTML within 400ms are frequently omitted from real-time AI retrieval pipelines.",
